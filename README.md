# Keyon's Journal
Full Angular-PHP-MYSQL app for journalling.
https://keyonsjournal.tk

## Inspiration
I made this web app for my co-op at STEP Software.
I was challenged by the wonderful people who work there to learn Angular 8, PHP, and MYSQL in 3 weeks to produce a fully-functional app with my time there.

### Why a journalling app?
Most people have a journalling app they go to for everything—for Android users it could be the Memo app, for iPhone users just Notes, and if you like keeping notes on the cloud you might use Google Keep.
There are a couple problems with these types of apps:
- Take long to sign into because of their ecosystems (Google Keep, using your Google account) 
- Security on public wifi (even if it is safe, most wouldn't want to sign into their Google accounts on public wifi if they don't need to)
- Save notes locally only (Android Memo app)

Keyon's Journal is a lightweight solution for storing **simple, insensitive** information as quickly as possible. No external app integrations. No overwhelming UI. 

### What I learned
- PHP 
- MYSQL
- Angular 8 
- TypeScript
- Client to server to database structure

### What's next
In order to learn Angular, I used Maximilian Schwarzmüller's [Angular 8 -The Complete Guide](http://google.com) course on Udemy. I had limited time at my co-op, so I did not finish the 37 hour course while there—I'll need to look into it on my own time! I recognize that there are still gaps in my Angular knowledge and can't wait to dive back in.

As for PHP and MYSQL, I'd like to take a formal course on those as well to expand my knowledge.
